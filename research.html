  In this paper, we studied the problem of finding decentralized controllers for large-scale heterogeneous
  robot swarms exhibiting segregative behaviors. As seen in nature, Segregative behaviors involve sorting
  a group of robots into groups based on their type. Our approach involves learning controllers that utilize
  local information at test time by imitating the policy of a centralized controller based on a differential
  potential concept at training time. We parameterized our policy using a time-varying aggregation graph neural
  network with multi-hop communication. This incorporates information not only from immediate neighbors but
   distant neighbors. We showed that our controller outperformed a local controller that considers only
   immediate neighbors and achieved similar performance to the centralized controller through varied
   experiments. In addition, we demonstrated the scalability of our method by exploring larger swarms
   and different groups.

  Different approaches to Visual-Inertial odometry(VIO) has been presented in literature.
  However, few research works exploits the quadrotor translational and rotational dynamics
  and the known thrust and torque inputs. Additional information from the dynamics with known
  control inputs improves the state estimation. This paper is focused on the estimation of the
  quadrotor UAV 6 DOF pose by fusing the information from the dynamics of the quadrotor coupled
  with visual-inertial measurements using an Unscented Kalman Filter. The thrust and torque inputs
  drives the prediction model while the VIO system provides 6 DOF pose, velocity and unbiased angular
  velocity of the vehicle. The results shows that our approach improves the state estimates by about
  2-5% in translation and 37% in rotation.

  In this paper, we present an algorithm to optimally track a non-cooperative quadrotor using a team of Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs)
  which are equipped with GPS as well as radar capable of sensing range, azimuth angle and elevation angle
  measurements. First, a distributed information filter algorithm is developed for each UGV to locally
  estimate the position and velocity of the quadrotor using its information and information from neighboring
  UGVs. We then fuse the information from various UGVs using a Consensus Filter such that their estimate of
  the state of the quadrotor converges. However, the accuracy of the estimation by the consensus filter
  depends upon the relative position of the sensors. Hence, it is necessary to design a control policy
  that leads to optimum configuration of UGVs in order to maximize the utility of measurement.
  A Model Predictive Controller(MPC) is developed to optimally control the UGVs to improve the
  state estimation. By defining a proper cost function and optimization algorithm in MPC, we are able
  to control the path of UGVs to increase the accuracy of estimating the position and velocity of a
  non-cooperative quadrotor.

  This paper presents an efficient robot navigation model in a multi-target domain amidst static and
  dynamic workspace obstacles. The problem is that of developing an optimal algorithm to minimize the total
  travel time of a robot as it visits all target points within its task domain amidst unknown workspace
  obstacles and finally return to its initial position. In solving this problem, a classical algorithm was
  first developed to compute the optimal number of paths to be travelled by the robot amidst the network
  of paths. The principle of shortest distance between robot and targets was used to compute the target
  point visitation order amidst workspace obstacles. A hybrid modelling scheme premised on geometrical
  considerations was applied to determine the length of obstacles encountered by the robot. Also, a dynamic
   model premised on the collapse of the radiation cone was proposed and used to estimate the velocity of
   a dynamic obstacle along the robot’s path.
