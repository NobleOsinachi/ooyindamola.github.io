  	<h1 class="h1_style">About Me</h1>
      <p>
        I am a PhD candidate in Cooperative Distributed Systems Lab at the University of Cincinnati, Ohio, where I am advised by
        <a href="https://researchdirectory.uc.edu/p/kumarmu"  target="_blank">Professor Manish Kumar</a>.
        I am currently a Digital Future Fellow working on developing a human digital twin for industrial applications. I previously received a B.S. in Systems Engineering at
        the University of Lagos in Nigeria in 2016, and an M.S. in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Cincinnati in 2021.
        <br /><br />



       Previously, I interned twice at NVIDIA. In 2021, I was an AI marketing engineer where I authored the first
       <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/deep-learning-ai/solutions/conversational-ai/introduction/ebook-sign-up/"  target="_blank">Introduction
       to NVIDIA Conversational AI eBook</a>. An area I had to learn in less than three months. In 2022, I interned as a Product marketing manager focused on the robotics
       developer community. Working with cross functional teams such as research, engineering, product and technical marketing in Robotics, I have the requisite knowledge
        in developing industry-level and production-grade robotics softwares.

      <h2 class = "h2_style text-center" >Research Interests</h1>
        My research focus is state estimation, multi-agent deep reinforcement learning, and AI for robotics. Previously, I have worked on sensor fusion and localization algorithms for mobile robots (single-agent and multi-agent cooperative localization) and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) using different Kalman filters. I am currently working on imitation and deep reinforcement learning to control robot swarms.
 Specifically, I design decentralized controllers for large robot swarms that exhibit behaviors in nature and explore deep RL techniques for competitive games.  <br>
        <br>
        <p>In summary, my interests are not limited to:</p>
        <ul>

        <li>
         <b>Deep Reinforcement learning in robotics:</b> robot swarms and competitve games.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Industrial Metaverse:</b> Digital Human Twin Motion Modeling.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Sensor Fusion and Localization:</b> Visual, Inertial, and Lidar sensors, ground, and aerial robots in indoor and outdoor environments.
        </li>
        <li>
          Classification using Computer Vision and Machine learning techniques.
        </li>
      </ul>
